                    This is essentially a reprinting of a standard work first published in 1965. Volume 8, Modern Art,
                    has a dozen new biographies of artists of the 1970s and 1980s with reproductions of their works. But
                    most of the set remains unchanged, with biographies of more than 650 European, American, and Asian
                    artists and essays on historical periods and schools of art. The only coverage of African art is in
                    a discussion of its influence on modern sculpture. The more than 4,000 photographs, many of them
                    beautiful colorplates, are the set's best feature.
